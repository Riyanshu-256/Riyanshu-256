## 👋 **About Me**

Hey! I’m **Riyanshu Sharma**, a Computer Science student at **UCET Hazaribagh**, and someone who lives and breathes **code, curiosity, and consistency**.

Growing up in Jharkhand, I didn't always have access to top-tier resources—but that never stopped me from pushing the limits of what I could build. From diving deep into Java and DSA to exploring full-stack web dev and cloud tech, every line of code I write is a step closer to mastering this ever-evolving tech universe.

---

## ⚡ **What Drives Me**

> I don’t just follow tutorials — I break them down, rebuild them, and make them mine.

I’m a strong believer in **"build-first" learning**. That means:  
- Taking a problem,  
- Writing the logic,  
- Testing the limits,  
- And shipping it—bugs, features, polish and all.  

Every project I touch is more than just code—it's a reflection of hours spent debugging, structuring logic, securing APIs, and refining UX until it *feels right*.

---

## 🧠 **How I Learn**

Whether it’s Java OOP or JavaScript ES6, async flows or backend auth systems—I follow a loop that works:

**Learn → Apply → Break → Fix → Repeat**

That’s how I:
- Understood recursion not just in theory, but by solving real-time DSA challenges.
- Built REST APIs with Node.js that go beyond CRUD and into security, auth, and folder structuring.
- Crafted UI layouts that are responsive, accessible, and actually enjoyable to use.

And I’m not stopping there. I’m moving deeper into:
- **React + Next.js** for scalable frontend systems  
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** for flexible and fast data handling  
- **CI/CD pipelines** for smooth, production-grade deployments

  🧩 Grid – advanced responsive structure
  🌀 Animations – transitions, keyframes
  🎨 Styling – colors, fonts, shadows
  📱 Responsive Design – media queries

⚡JavaScript – Emoji Ideas for Content Points
  🧠 Logic – conditions, loops, functions
  📦 Arrays – map, filter, reduce
  🕹️ DOM Manipulation – querySelector, addEventListener
  🎮 Event Handling – clicks, keypresses, input
  🧩 Objects – properties, methods, nesting
  🚀 ES6+ – destructuring, arrow functions, spread/rest

🛠️ Web Projects – Emoji Ideas for Features
  🎲 Guessing Game – random logic, score
  🐷 Pig Game – multiplayer turns, dice logic
  🏦 Bankist App – login, transfer, close account
