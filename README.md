## 👋 **About Me**

Hey! I’m **Riyanshu Sharma**, a Computer Science student at **UCET Hazaribagh**, and someone who lives and breathes **code, curiosity, and consistency**.

Growing up in Jharkhand, I didn't always have access to top-tier resources—but that never stopped me from pushing the limits of what I could build. From diving deep into Java and DSA to exploring full-stack web dev and cloud tech, every line of code I write is a step closer to mastering this ever-evolving tech universe.

---

## ⚡ **What Drives Me**

> I don’t just follow tutorials — I break them down, rebuild them, and make them mine.

I’m a strong believer in **"build-first" learning**. That means:  
- Taking a problem,  
- Writing the logic,  
- Testing the limits,  
- And shipping it—bugs, features, polish and all.  

Every project I touch is more than just code—it's a reflection of hours spent debugging, structuring logic, securing APIs, and refining UX until it *feels right*.

## 🧠 **How I Learn**

Whether it’s Java OOP or JavaScript ES6, async flows or backend auth systems—I follow a loop that works:

**Learn → Apply → Break → Fix → Repeat**

That’s how I:
- Understood recursion not just in theory, but by solving real-time DSA challenges.
- Built REST APIs with Node.js that go beyond CRUD and into security, auth, and folder structuring.
- Crafted UI layouts that are responsive, accessible, and actually enjoyable to use.

And I’m not stopping there. I’m moving deeper into:
- **React + Next.js** for scalable frontend systems  
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** for flexible and fast data handling  
- **CI/CD pipelines** for smooth, production-grade deployments

## ⚙️ **My Stack: The Tools That Build My World**

I keep things modern but practical.

On the frontend, I move fast with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and dive deep into **React** to architect clean and reusable components. I’m transitioning into **Next.js** to add server-side rendering and better SEO to my stack.

On the backend, **Node.js and Express** help me ship APIs that are secure, modular, and lightning fast. I use **JWT and Bcrypt** to lock things down, and **MongoDB** for handling dynamic data with Mongoose models that actually make sense.

For testing and iteration, **Postman**, **Thunder Client**, and **MongoDB Compass** are always running.  
Version control? **Git + GitHub** — no compromise there.  
My editor of choice? **VS Code**, fully customized for speed and clarity.

## 🧱 **What I’ve Built & Learned (So Far)**

I’ve worked on **full backend systems** with secure authentication, protected routes, token management, and modular folder structures — and believe me, nothing teaches you backend better than wiring up JWT flows and watching the 403s roll in until you fix them.

I've created **responsive landing pages** that look sharp on any screen, learning the magic of Flexbox, Grid, and media queries in the process. Micro-interactions, smooth transitions, and UI logic? That’s where CSS starts feeling like art.

In Java, I’ve built **mini apps and practice tools** that helped me master OOP principles, exception handling, and modular logic. The kind of foundation that makes you write better code no matter the language.

And I’m currently brewing something new — an **API-first product** that’ll serve as my public proof of clean, testable, and production-ready backend architecture.
